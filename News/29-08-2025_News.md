## 💡 Analysis & Context
Today's events reveal a world grappling with heightened fragmentation and confrontational politics. The parallel escalations in **Gaza** and **Ukraine** underscore a deepening international instability, with diplomatic channels under severe strain. The EU's unified stance against Russia, contrasted with Hungary's abstention, highlights both the strength and the internal fissures of Western alliances.

The overarching theme is one of challenged authority, whether on the battlefield, in political institutions, or within international law.

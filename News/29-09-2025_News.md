## 💡 Analysis & Context
Today's developments underscore a world grappling with entrenched conflicts and deepening political divides. The firm rhetoric from European leaders against Russia suggests the Ukraine war is entering a phase of strategic endurance, where economic and military attrition will be decisive. Simultaneously, the planned Trump-Netanyahu meeting introduces a wildcard into Middle East diplomacy, potentially sidelining current administrative efforts. The analysis of fan behavior at the Ryder Cup as a reflection of "Trump's all-caps America" illustrates a pervasive theme: the erosion of decorum in public life, mirroring the polarization of the political landscape. These events collectively point to a period of sustained global instability where diplomatic norms are being tested and redefined.

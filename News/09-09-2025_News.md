## 💡 Analysis & Context
Today's events highlight a theme of systemic fragility and accountability. In France, President Macron's attempt to govern from a fractured center has resulted in endemic instability, as noted in expert analysis. This reflects a broader trend seen in the UK, where columnist Polly Toynbee argues that Labour's primary mission must now be to counter the hard-right's influence, suggesting a deep polarization of Western politics. Meanwhile, revelations about Boris Johnson and Donald Trump underscore a crisis of conduct for past leaders, raising fundamental questions about the boundaries between public service and private interest. The populist right's strategy, as one commentator notes, often involves erasing historical context—a tactic that is being actively challenged by these new disclosures.

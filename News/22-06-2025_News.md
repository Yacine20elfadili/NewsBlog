## 💡 Analysis & Context
The day's events are dominated by the **strategic gamble of the US strike on Iran**. Multiple analyses suggest this was a "trap" laid by Israeli PM Netanyahu, which President Trump embraced. Far from preventing a nuclear Iran, commentators argue this action may provoke Tehran to aggressively pursue a weapon as its ultimate deterrent. The move signals a potential departure from the "Maga isolationist" stance and will have profound and lasting consequences, regardless of White House rhetoric. The world is now watching for Iran's response, which will dictate whether the situation de-escalates or spirals into a devastating regional war.

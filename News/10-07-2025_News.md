## 💡 Analysis & Context
**The day's events paint a picture of a fragmented and tense global landscape. Two major themes stand out: first, the hardening of geopolitical fault lines, evidenced by the direct US-Russia diplomatic clash, the landmark MH17 ruling, and the UK's elevated threat assessment of Iran. This suggests a move away from diplomacy towards direct confrontation and legal accountability between major powers. Second, the Trump administration's policies on trade, science, and international law are creating significant disruption, fostering an environment of strategic unpredictability that affects both domestic institutions like NASA and international bodies like the UN. These parallel trends of geopolitical hardening and policy volatility signal a period of heightened global risk and uncertainty.**

## 💡 Analysis & Context
Today's news landscape is defined by a stark contrast between intense international diplomacy and severe domestic paralysis. While the world's attention is fixed on a potential breakthrough in the Middle East, the US political system is mired in a self-inflicted crisis, impacting everything from travel to governance.

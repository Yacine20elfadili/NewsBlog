## 💡 Analysis & Context
The day's events are overwhelmingly shaped by **President Trump's** volatile and personalized approach to foreign policy, which has now culminated in direct military action against Iran. The subsequent claims of total victory, disputed by figures within his own party, create a high-stakes environment of uncertainty. This dynamic is mirrored at the NATO summit, where European allies appear to be navigating a fine line between placating the US President and addressing their own pressing security concerns. The overarching theme is one of institutional strain—from the Federal Reserve to constitutional checks on war powers—as a highly unpredictable administration asserts its authority on both the global and domestic stages.

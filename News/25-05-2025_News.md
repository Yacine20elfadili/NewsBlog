## 💡 Analysis & Context
Today's news reflects a world grappling with the consequences of **"forever war,"** as one analyst notes that leaders like Netanyahu and Putin view perpetual conflict as essential to their political survival, a reality the US has struggled to influence. This is mirrored in the societal trauma reported from Gaza, where children are bombed and starved, forcing a difficult societal reckoning with collective responsibility. In the US, ideological battles are intensifying, with warnings to **"remember the 1930s"** serving as a backdrop to domestic debates over Trump's agenda, the legacy of the "Defund" movement, and the weaponization of women's bodies as state property. These events underscore a growing global dissonance between systemic crises and the continuation of daily life.

## 💡 Analysis & Context
The day's events highlight a clear global trend of political reckoning and realignment. In Australia, voters delivered a powerful mandate to the center-left, explicitly rejecting a conservative campaign seen as echoing Trump-style politics. This theme of responding to the Trump legacy is also evident in the US, where legal and administrative actions are actively unwinding his administration's policies on media freedom and climate science.

Meanwhile, intractable conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza continue to escalate with devastating human costs, demonstrating that major power diplomacy has yet to find a path toward de-escalation. These geopolitical crises stand in stark contrast to domestic political shifts, reminding stakeholders that while national priorities may change, international instability remains a dangerous constant.

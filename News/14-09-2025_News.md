## 💡 Analysis & Context
Today's events highlight a world grappling with resurgent nationalism and geopolitical brinkmanship. The Russian drone incident is not an isolated military event but a calculated probe of NATO's resolve, occurring in a vacuum of perceived weakness in US foreign policy leadership, as some analysts suggest. Simultaneously, the massive far-right rally in London demonstrates that these international tensions are mirrored by deep-seated domestic frictions, where anti-immigrant sentiment and populist anger are becoming potent, organized forces. These trends, coupled with rising political violence in the US, point to a volatile global environment where democratic institutions and international alliances face severe, interconnected tests.

## 💡 Analysis & Context
The day's events weave two dominant, intersecting narratives. The first is a stark picture of escalating global conflict, most acutely visible in **Gaza**, where humanitarian aid systems are collapsing under direct military assault. This is echoed by **Russia's** unwavering aggression in Ukraine, which continues despite diplomatic overtures, demonstrating a global trend toward hard power.

The second narrative centers on the immense political and legal gravity surrounding **Donald Trump**. The confluence of new revelations in the **Epstein case**, a hardline policy shift on immigration, and a disruptive foreign policy move (withdrawing from Unesco) paints a picture of a potential future administration poised for confrontation on both domestic and international fronts. Together, these stories highlight a period of intense instability, where humanitarian norms are under threat abroad and political foundations are being shaken at home.

## 💡 Analysis & Context
**A clear pattern of preemptive action and strategic positioning dominates today's events. The diplomatic flurry before the Trump-Putin summit is mirrored by Russia's own briefing of North Korea, suggesting a coordinated non-Western bloc. Expert analysis, cited from The Guardian, warns that President Trump's desire for a "deal" could lead him to accept Putin's narratives, posing a significant threat to Ukrainian sovereignty. Concurrently, the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard in D.C. is viewed by critics not as a security measure, but as a "sheer demonstration of power." In the Middle East, the formal approval of a Gaza attack plan—coupled with reporting that Israel is "wiping out Gaza's journalists"—indicates a shift from conflict to a potentially devastating and less-witnessed new phase.**
